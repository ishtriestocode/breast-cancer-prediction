# Breast Cancer Detection Project

## Overview

Welcome to my breast cancer detection project! My goal is to create a model that can help detect breast cancer early, potentially saving lives. 

## Project Structure

1. **Data**: I've collected data from reliable sources.
2. **Analysis**: I've analyzed the data to understand breast cancer patterns.
3. **Modeling**: I've built a machine learning model for breast cancer detection.
4. **Results**: I've evaluated our model and summarized the findings.

## Getting Started

To run the project:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the main script.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
